## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Deeptika Kannan, a software engineer and recent graduate in computer science from the University of Florida (Go Gators!).  I'm passionate about building scalable, data-driven solutions that make a real impact. With experience in AI-powered solutions, large-scale data analysis, and cloud-based microservices, I thrive on solving complex challenges using Python, Java, React, and modern data engineering tools. Beyond tech,Â I'm a proud advocate for women in tech, and I'm passionate about leveraging technology for community outreach.
